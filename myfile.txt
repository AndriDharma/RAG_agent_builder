The AORUS 15P sounds excellent for demanding gamers, with its 10th-gen Intel i7 processor and GeForce RTX 30 series graphics card.  If a slightly older GPU is acceptable, the AORUS 17 and ROG Zephyrus S GX531 (with an RTX 2080 and RTX 20 series respectively) are also good choices.  For casual gaming, the Acer Nitro 5 is a good option.  The Raider GE78 HX is another solid choice for advanced/professional gamers.  Finally, if you need a slim laptop for both gaming and workstation use, the AERO 17 with its 144Hz IPS display might fit the bill.

If you're looking for a slim laptop, I have several recommendations:

* **For Gaming:** The ROG Zephyrus GX701 is a very thin 17" gaming laptop.  The Stealth 15 is the thinnest gaming laptop in the MSI line.  Other options include the AERO 17, AORUS 15X, and Legion Y740s.  If you need something exceptionally portable, the GX700VO is a lightweight gaming notebook.

* **For General Use:**  The HP Spectre x360 14 is a thin laptop with good features.  The ASUS Zenbook Classic - UX5400/UM5401 is another slim option with a high-resolution display. The ASUS Zenbook S 13 OLED UX5304 is also very thin and light.  If you're interested in a convertible, the ASUS Chromebook Flip C436 is extremely slim and lightweight.
