The AORUS 15P sounds excellent for demanding gamers, with its 10th-gen Intel i7 processor and GeForce RTX 30 series graphics card.  If a slightly older GPU is acceptable, the AORUS 17 and ROG Zephyrus S GX531 (with an RTX 2080 and RTX 20 series respectively) are also good choices.  For casual gaming, the Acer Nitro 5 is a good option.  The Raider GE78 HX is another solid choice for advanced/professional gamers.  Finally, if you need a slim laptop for both gaming and workstation use, the AERO 17 with its 144Hz IPS display might fit the bill.

If you're looking for a slim laptop, I have several recommendations:

* **For Gaming:** The ROG Zephyrus GX701 is a very thin 17" gaming laptop.  The Stealth 15 is the thinnest gaming laptop in the MSI line.  Other options include the AERO 17, AORUS 15X, and Legion Y740s.  If you need something exceptionally portable, the GX700VO is a lightweight gaming notebook.

* **For General Use:**  The HP Spectre x360 14 is a thin laptop with good features.  The ASUS Zenbook Classic - UX5400/UM5401 is another slim option with a high-resolution display. The ASUS Zenbook S 13 OLED UX5304 is also very thin and light.  If you're interested in a convertible, the ASUS Chromebook Flip C436 is extremely slim and lightweight.

For a high-performance gaming experience, I recommend the AORUS 15P. It's built for demanding esports enthusiasts and features a 10th-generation Intel i7 processor and a GeForce RTX 30 graphics card.  Another great option, the AORUS 17, includes an Intel Core i9 processor and NVIDIA GeForce RTX 20 graphics card. The ROG Zephyrus S GX531 is also a good choice; it's compact, slim, and packs an 8th-gen Intel processor and GeForce RTX 2080 graphics card, kept cool with its Active Aerodynamic System.  If those are outside your budget, consider the Acer Nitro 5, which offers excellent graphics and processing power at a more casual gamer price point.  Gamers who also need portability might like the AORUS 15X with its slim, less than 2.1 cm thick chassis. Other options include the Predator Triton 700 and ASUS GX700VO.

For a cheap laptop I recommend the Acer Aspire 5 A515-45-R74Z. It is currently on sale at Amazon for $329.99, which is 28% off its original price of $459.99. It has a 15.6" FHD IPS display, an AMD Ryzen 5 5500U Hexa-Core Mobile Processor, 8GB DDR4 RAM, a 256GB PCIe NVMe SSD, and WiFi 6. It comes with Windows 11 Home.

For a powerful gaming experience, I recommend the AORUS 15P.  It's designed for demanding e-sports enthusiasts and features a 10th-generation Intel i7 processor and a GeForce RTX 30 graphics card.  The AORUS 17 is also a great option with an Intel Core i9 processor and NVIDIA GeForce RTX 20 graphics card.

If you prefer a thinner and more portable gaming laptop, consider the ROG Zephyrus S GX531 or the AORUS 15X. The Zephyrus boasts an 8th-generation Intel processor and a GeForce RTX 2080, while the AORUS 15X offers contemporary features in a slim chassis.

Gamers looking for a more budget-friendly option might consider the Acer Nitro 5, which offers good performance and an attractive style.  For high performance in a thin chassis, the Predator Triton 700 is another excellent choice with its Intel Core i7 processor and NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080.
